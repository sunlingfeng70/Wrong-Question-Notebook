The Wrong Question Notebook (WQN) is a web application designed to help students systematically track, organise, and revise the problems they answered incorrectly. It provides a comprehensive system for managing problems across multiple notebooks, tracking progress with detailed statistics, and facilitating effective revision through structured review sessions.

**Live:** [wqn.magicworks.app](https://wqn.magicworks.app/)

## Features

### Notebook & Problem Management

- Create colour-coded notebooks (formerly "subjects") with custom icons to organise problems
- **Three problem types**: Multiple Choice (MCQ), Short Answer, and Extended Response
- **Rich text editor** (TipTap) with formatting, LaTeX math equations, tables, lists, images, and more
- **Enhanced answer config**: MCQ radio-button picker, multi-answer short text, numeric answers with tolerance
- **Auto-marking**: Automatic answer validation for supported problem types
- **Status tracking**: Mark problems as Wrong, Needs Review, or Mastered
- **File attachments**: Upload images and PDFs as problem assets or solution assets
- Sortable and filterable problem tables with faceted search

### Tag System

- Create and manage tags within notebooks
- Tag problems with multiple tags for flexible categorisation
- Filter problems by tags
- Per-notebook tag management (create, rename, delete)

### Problem Sets & Review Sessions

- Create manual or **Smart Sets** (auto-populated via saved filter configs)
- **Sharing levels**: Private, Limited (share with specific users via email), or Public
- **Session-based review**: Start, pause, and resume review sessions
- Per-problem answer submission with auto-marking or self-assessment
- **Session summary**: Post-review statistics and breakdown
- Solution reveal after attempting problems

### Discovery & Social

- **Public Discovery page** (`/discover`) with PostgreSQL full-text search (tsvector + GIN), subject category filters, quality-biased ranking refreshed by `pg_cron`, and cursor-based infinite scroll
- **Social engagement** on public problem sets: bounce-filtered view tracking, likes, favourites, copy counts, and a report / flag mechanism for moderation
- **Creator profiles** at `/creators/[username]` with avatar, bio, aggregate engagement stats, and a grid of listed sets
- **Listed / unlisted toggle** with a subject category picker — opt into Discovery only when a set is ready to share
- **Favourites tab** on the problem sets page for quick access to saved sets
- **Username-based identity**: usernames are auto-generated from email and editable from the profile sheet
- **SEO**: dynamic `app/sitemap.ts` covering listed public sets and creator profiles, plus OpenGraph, Twitter Card, and JSON-LD metadata on public set pages

### Statistics Dashboard

- GitHub-style **activity heatmap**
- **Status doughnut chart**: Wrong / Needs Review / Mastered breakdown
- **Progress line chart**: Cumulative mastery over time
- **Subject bar & radar charts**: Per-notebook comparisons
- Hero stat cards (streaks, totals, session stats)
- Recent activity feed

### AI Problem Extraction

- Extract problems from images using **Doubao (Volcengine Ark) vision LLM**
- Daily usage quota with per-user admin overrides
- Supports auto-detection of problem type, choices, and correct answers

### User Profile

- Customisable profile (avatar, username, bio, demographics)

### Authentication & Security

- Email-based signup and login
- Password reset flow with email confirmation
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- HTML sanitisation (DOMPurify + sanitize-html) with math content support
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Request validation with Zod schemas

### Privacy & Compliance

- **GDPR-compliant cookie consent** banner with granular preferences
- Privacy Policy page
